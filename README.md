Rust Design Patterns

# Playground
This is the preferred way to compile and test one's code online.

https://play.rust-lang.org

The aim of this repository is to learn RUST by changing some code initially. Initial focus is, but not limited to, data structures. 
As one aquires more skillset they may introduce advanced functions gradually.
This assumes the reader is familiar with programming languages like C, C++, Python, Java.

According to the above URL 

"Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code."

This repository is intended to understand and apply some concepts through small projects. These ideas may then be extended to a real-world application.


In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose. This URL covers three main groups of patterns:

    1. Creational patterns: provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

    2. Structural patterns: explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

    3. Behavioral patterns: take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

I am very new to RUST programming (as of June 2023)  and may inadvertently have listed code that is not optimized.

Code may be unnecessarily over-engineered and may possibly be simplified. I will keep updating as I get more familiar with RUST. Use this code at your own risk!
